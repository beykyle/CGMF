CGMF, Cascading Gamma-ray Multiplicity and Fission
==================================================

This is a modified version of [lanl/CGMF](https://github.com/lanl/CGMF) for use in uncertainty quantification. The new capabilities include the added options listed below. Includes the following dependencies which are automatically downloaded and integrated by the build system:
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for parsing json formatted parameter files
- [beykyle/omplib](https://github.com/beykyle/omplib) a library of optical model potentials

Abstract
--------


CGMF is a code that simulates the emission of prompt fission neutrons and gamma rays from excited fission fragments right after scission. It implements a Monte Carlo version of the Hauser-Feshbach statistical theory of nuclear reactions to follow the decay of the fission fragments on an event-by-event basis. Probabilities for emitting neutrons and gamma rays are computed at each stage of the decay. Each fission event history records characteristics of the parent fragment (mass, charge, kinetic energy, momentum vector, excitation energy, spin, parity) and the number (multiplicity) and characteristics (energy, direction) of the prompt neutrons and gamma rays emitted in this event.

Building, Testing and Installing Instructions
---------------------------------------------

0) Optional, set CGMFDATA environment variable to point to data/ directory
1) Create a build directory
2) Change to build directory
3) Configuration: type `cmake ..` and then `make` for default build
    * The `..` needs to point to the top-level CGMF directory
    * Options:
        * CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE [Debug, RelWithDebInfo, Release]
        * CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX [path/to/install/directory]
        * cgmf.shared_library [ON/OFF (default)]
        * cgmf.x.MPI [ON/OFF (default)]
        * cgmf.tests [(default) ON/OFF]
5) Building: type `make` for default build
    * This creates the static library `libcgmf.a` in the build/libcgmf directory
    * This creates the executable `cgmf.x` in the build/utils/cgmf directory
6) Testing: type `make test` or `ctest` to run the default tests
7) Installing: type `make install` to install CGMF
    * This creates the following directory structure in the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directory:
        * bin/ [contains cgmf executable]
        * include/cgmf-1.1.0 [contains cgmf header files]
        * lib/cgmf-1.1.0 [contains libcgmf library]
        * share/data/cgmf-1.1.0 [contains cgmf data files]

Example configuration in release mode with build, test and install:
* `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install -Dcgmf.x.MPI=ON ..`
* `make && ctest && make install`
* If the build and tests pass:
    * This creates the static library `libcgmf.a` in the build directory
    * This creates the executable `cgmf.mpi.x` in the build/utils/cgmf directory
    * This installs bin, lib, cgmf/data, and cgmf/include directories into install directory

Execution Instructions and Options
----------------------------------

`./cgmf.x [options]`

Options:

	-i $ZAIDt   		[required]	1000*Z+A of target nucleus, or fissioning nucleus if spontaneous fission
	-e $Einc    		[required]	incident neutron energy in MeV (0.0 for spontaneous fission)
	-n $nevents 		[optional]	number of Monte Carlo fission events to run or to be read. If $nevents is negative, produces initial fission fragments yields Y(A,Z,KE,U,J,p)
	-s $startingEvent	[optional]	skip ahead to particular Monte Carlo event (1 is default)
	-f $filename		[optional]	fission histories or yields result file (default: "histories.cgmf" or "yields.cgmf")
	-t $timeCoinc		[optional]	time coincidence window for long-lived isomer gamma-ray emission cutoff (in sec)
	-d $datapath		[optional]	overrides the environment variable CGMFDATA and default datapath
	-o $omppath		[optional]	use custom Koning-Delaroche global OM params, formatted in json at given path
	-r $seed                [optional]      use custom RNG seed (Note: RANDOM_SEED_BY_ARG must be set to true in config.h)
	-g $ZAIDsf              [optional]      Only de-excites fragments correspinding to ZAIDsf, with excitation energy, spin, parity, and TKE
	                                        all sampled as if that fragment was produced by the fissioning nucleus


---
Results
-------

A concise summary of average results is displayed on the standard output, and event-by-event results or initial fragment distributions are saved in "histories.cgmf" or "yields.cgmf" (default names).
